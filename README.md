# Dailymotion-video-auto-upload-

Dailymotion video auto-upload using Selenium with Python:

Replace line 21 with the email and line 25 with the password.

Replace line 38 with the path of the video, using the video name as the Dailymotion title for ease.

Replace line 42 with the description.

After the description, there may still be some elements that require automatic clicking. I will try to update it in the future, or if you know a way to handle those elements, please let me know.
